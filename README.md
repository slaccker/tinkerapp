## Implementation using Angular

Components

- Angular FE
- C# Dotnet Core BE

### Description

Using the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), create a solution that allows users to view the newest stories from the feed.

Using an Angular front-end app that calls a C# .NET Core back-end restful API.

### At a minimum, the front-end UI should consist of:

- A list of the newest stories
- Each list item should include the title and a link to the news article. Watch out for stories that do not have hyperlinks!
- A search feature that allows users to find stories
- A paging mechanism. While we love reading, 200 stories on the page is a bit much.
- Automated tests for your code

### The back-end API shows:

- Usage of dependency injection, it's built-in so why not?
- Caching of the newest stories
- Automated tests for your code
